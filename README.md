# My Life

I was born on May 8, 2012 in Phoenix Arizona. I was born with ADHD, a bit of autism, and a disorder that makes me more likely to become a bad person as I grow older (thats all I know, I may have more). Over the first 8 years of my life, I had already excelled throughout 1st-3rd grade and I actually had to walk to the third grade classrooms for math during first grade. I moved in 2020, over to the Glendale area from my Peoria-Phoenix area. We moved at the best possible time because I kid you not, COVID-19 had started to spread and online classes started. I have had two lifelong friends, **Martin** and **Quinlan**. I helped Quinlan work through his autism during the time when we were at the same school together. I had gotten bullied a lot for my personality for a majority of my life, and I still do, just toned down a lot. I have made a lot of friends during my middle school career, however, which balanced it out pretty well. I joined the wrestling team at my school for a season, but it just wasn't for me. I haven't been much of a fighter nor a person that can take many hits. That experience on the team, however, made me mature and was actually the driving cause towards making friends because I wasn't an akward nerd after. I started to open up. Some more about me, I played soccer for 7 years, four in rec and three in competitive. That was a sport I could handle. I love playing music too. Throughout 5th and 6th and about two weeks of 7th grade I played the trumpet, made Honor Band and All State in my 6th grade year. I switched to French Horn and have been working with it since, taking lessons with the best hornist in all of Arizona, Mr. Cilone, the director of bands over at O'Connor High School. I continue to fulfill my love of coding and this page will definetly update as the years come and go! Thanks for reading my rant about my life, and have a great day!
